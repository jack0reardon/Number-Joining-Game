Rules
- Connect numbers to each other in pairs using a line. Pass through the same number of squares as indicated by the pair of numbers. For example, connect a 3 to a different 3 by passing through 3 squares and connect a 9 to a different 9 by passing through 9 squares.
- The line that you draw can only move in perpendicular directions (up, down, left and right). The length of each line drawn is measured by including the starting and ending squares which must contain numbers. So, a line of length 5 will connect two 5's via three blank squares.
- All numbers (except for 1's) come in pairs. 1's do not need connecting, as they connect to themselves - just colour these squares in. A blank square can be consumed by at most one line, so no intersecting lines are allowed. All numbers must be connected to complete the puzzle.
- There is only one unique solution to the puzzle and the lines drawn will form a picture when completed - colour in every square that contains a number or has a line through it.
